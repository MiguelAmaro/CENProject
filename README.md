Tasks
- [ ] Forming a group:
  a. Students can choose their own groups (2, 3, or 4 students) or work individually.
  b. Students should aim for a diverse set of skills and backgrounds to maximize group performance.
  c. Set up a communication channel for the group, such as email, instant messaging, or project management tools (Slack, Trello, or Teams).

- [ ] Defining the topic:
  a. Brainstorm project ideas as a group, considering the course and final project objectives and individual interests.
  b. Evaluate and narrow down the ideas based on feasibility, resources, and relevance.
  c. Finalize a topic and create a project outline, including objectives, tasks, and deadlines.

- [ ] Choosing an API:
  a. Research available APIs related to the chosen topic or project requirements.
  b. Compare APIs based on factors like ease of use, reliability, cost, and data quality.
  c. Select the most suitable API for the project, considering the group's skill level and project needs.

- [ ] Reading the API documentation:
  a. Locate and read the API documentation to understand its features, endpoints, and data formats.
  b. Review any code examples, sample requests, and best practices provided in the documentation.
  c. Discuss and clarify any ambiguities or questions within the group or consult professor Gregory or the TAs if needed.

- [ ] Setting up the development environment:
  a. Set up a new project in PyCharm or use an existing Python project. Make sure libraries, or tools required for working with the chosen API are properly installed.
  b. Recommended: Set up a shared version control system (e.g., Git) for collaborative coding and project tracking.

- [ ] Testing the API:
  a. Obtain any necessary API keys or access tokens, following the documentation's instructions.
  b. Write a simple script or program to send requests to the API and fetch sample data (no need to test directly with the Streamlit framework here).
  c. Test various endpoints and parameters to ensure a proper understanding of the API's capabilities. How often can you make requests?
  d. Handle and troubleshoot any errors or issues that arise during testing, referring to the documentation or seeking assistance as needed.

- [ ] Integrating the API into the project:
  a. Develop the project's core functionality using the API, incorporating the data retrieved into the project's design and objectives.
  b. Regularly communicate within the group, tracking progress and updating tasks as needed.
  c. Test the project frequently to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

- [ ] Finalizing the project:
  a. Review the project as a group, ensuring it meets the objectives and requirements.
  b. Make any necessary revisions and polish the project's presentation.
  c. Prepare and practice a project presentation or demonstration for the classroom.

- [ ] Presenting the project:
  a. Present the project to the class, showcasing its features, functionality, and the API integration.
  b. Answer any questions from the professor or classmates, providing insights into the development process and lessons learned.
